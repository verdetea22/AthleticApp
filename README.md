# StevensGO

## What is StevensGo about?
The pandemic had a damaging effect on the attendance of athletic department activities at Stevens, leading to the elimination of PE class requirements for several semesters as well as students no longer being able to gather in large groups. Since then, PE requirements have been reinstated but there has been a consistent decrease in involvement and awareness of intramural and club sports, as well as attendance to sport teams’ events.

To address the above problem, the team has created this application that allows students to view the calendar of upcoming various events and the ability to “sign in” to that they attend. There will be two categories of events: one will describe “active” events, where the student would be participating in the activity, and the other will describe “passive” events, where the student would be spreading school spirit by attending events. These two groups will be further broken down into tiers of participation that would be equated to a point system. If students were to earn enough points to meet a certain threshold, their involvement with various athletic programs could satisfy a PE class requirement, but also can be used for recreational fun.

This application aims to revitalize student interest in athletics and fitness at Stevens by providing a centralized platform for discovering and participating in sports-related activities, promoting community-building, and supporting the growth of clubs and teams. The goal for StevensGo is to motivate students to be active, provide a friendly alternative to standard physical education classes, and bring the Stevens community together in an exciting and new way that supports our athletics department’s efforts, planning, and execution. By leveraging technology and the spirit of competition, the app seeks to help students lead healthier, more active lives and contribute to a more vibrant campus community.
