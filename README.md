# AthleticApp

## What is Application about?
The pandemic had a damaging effect on the attendance of athletic department activities at Stevens, leading to the elimination of PE class requirements for several semesters. Now PE requirements are back in place but there has been a decrease of involvement and awareness of intramural and club sports, as well as attendance to sport teams’ events.

To address the above problem, the team has created this application that allows students to view the calendar of upcoming various events and the ability to “sign in” to that they attend. There will be two categories of events: one will describe “active” events, where the student would be participating in the activity, and the other will describe “passive” events, where the student would be spreading school spirit by attending events. These two groups will be further broken down into tiers of participation that would be equated to a point system. For example, within “active” events, some events will have a greater weight with regards to points accumulated than others, compared to “passive” events which will have tiers based on factors such as duration of attendance. If students were to earn enough points to meet a certain threshold, their involvement with various athletic programs could satisfy a PE class requirement, but also can be used for recreational fun. The goal for this application is to both motivate students to be active, provide a friendly alternative to standard physical education classes, and bring the Stevens community together in an exciting and new way that supports our athletics department’s efforts, planning, and execution.
